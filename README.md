Jsnapy
========

This small repository is intended for testing of a bug in Junpier/jsnapy.

Create a virtualenv and install the requirements.

To run it, set the `JSNAPY_HOME` environment variable to the current directory, so Jsnapy can find the `logging.yml` file.

```shell script
JSNAPY_HOME=./ python main.py
```
